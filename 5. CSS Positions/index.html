      <h1>Street Food Culture of India</h1>

      <p>
        India’s street food scene is one of the most vibrant in the world,
        offering a burst of flavors that reflect its diverse cultures. Every
        state boasts its own specialties — from spicy chaats in Delhi to tangy
        puchkas in Kolkata. These dishes are often sold from bustling roadside
        stalls, drawing locals and tourists alike. <br /><br />
        The magic of Indian street food lies in its variety and affordability. A
        few coins can buy you plates packed with aroma and taste, accompanied by
        the chatter and activity of the streets. Vendors often have secret
        family recipes passed down through generations, making each bite unique.
        <br /><br />
        Street food also serves as a social connector. People gather around
        stalls, share plates, and enjoy casual conversations. It’s not just
        about eating; it’s about experiencing community and city life in its
        truest form. <br />

      <h1>Regional Cuisines in India</h1>

      <p>
        India’s geography plays a huge role in shaping its regional cuisines.
        Coastal areas favor seafood and coconut-based curries, while the
        northern plains are known for wheat-based breads and rich gravies. Each
        region uses local produce and spices to create distinctive dishes.
        <br /><br />

        In Punjab, buttery parathas and creamy lassi dominate breakfast tables.
        Down south, you'll find idli, dosa, and sambhar bursting with tamarind
        and curry leaves. In the west, Gujarati thalis serve sweet and savory
        items together — a harmonious blend of flavors. <br /><br />

        These cuisines are not just about taste but traditions. Recipes often
        date back centuries, carrying stories of festivals, seasonal changes,
        and family rituals. Eating a regional dish is like tasting a chapter of
        India’s history. <br />
